## **Maxflow**

## Problems

1. Provide an example such that a greedy approach does not work.
2. What is the upperbound of the maxflow?
3. We can guarantee that Ford-Fulkerson works for irrational capacities. (T/F)
4. Provide a counterexample.
5. Make the residual graph for the following.
6. Run Ford-Fulkerson on this graph.
7. If breadth-first search was used instead of DFS, how would the algorithm change and what would be its runtime?
8. What if flow can be lost in each node?
9. Prove the flow-value lemma.
10. Prove Ford-Fulkerson
11. You are only changing the inputs when performing a reduction. (T/F)
12. What is the time complexity of vertex-disjoint path problem?
13. Bipartite Graph Question
