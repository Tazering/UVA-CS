Background Knowledge (3)
- Machine Learning
	- finetuning: process of finding the right non-trained parameters
- Robotics
	- Policies: what the robot does to achieve this goal
- LLM
	- LLM means large language model
	- Large language models (LLMs) are a category of foundation models trained on immense amounts of data making them capable of understanding and 
	  generating natural language and other types of content to perform a wide range of tasks.

- Abstract Syntax Tree
- Clusters
- chain-of-thoughts

Basic Information (6)
	- propose LRLL: Lifelong Robot Library Learning agent
	- Wake-Sleep
		- wake: agent interacts with environment + users in order to grow in experience
		- Sleep: reflects on experiences in order to expand capabilities

Related Works
	- Language to Action: ene-to-end policies for LLM require a LOT of data
		- can lead to forgetting
	- LLMs for Robot Control: chain LLMs with external models => more complex and preise policies
		- require manual prompt engineering
		- CAP: still requires human guidance
	- Memory and Context Retrieval
		- retrieve simplar task-code pairs from memory using similarity
		- not generalizable
	- Language-guided Skill Acquisition
		- [57] used multi-step human feedback to generate reward function for training
		- [58] LLM generate synthetic experience with reward conditions + distills successful trials into language conditioned policy with behavioral cloning
		- both struggle to get new skills

Strengths (3)
	- generalizability in learning new skills
	- memory efficient
Weaknesses (3)
	- limited by vision API
	- human demonstration input is language => limiting scalability to skills
	- initial prompts to exploration/abstraction modules need to be refined when changing domains or LLM engines
	- latency and price constraints
