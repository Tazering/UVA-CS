# ***Arrays and Big-O***

## **Determining Running Times**

Ask yourself
- how long will this algorithm take when n = 1
- n = 100?
- n = 1,000,000,000?

Running Times

$\Theta$(1)
- not size dependent

Big Theta => logarithmic
- cut list in half 

Big Theta => n
- process each element

Big Theta => n logn
- linear number of steps but each one takes log n time

Big Theta => n<sup>2</sup>
- quadratic time


$\Theta$(2<sup>n</sup>)
- exponential
