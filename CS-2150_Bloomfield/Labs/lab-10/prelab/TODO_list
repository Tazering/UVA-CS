1.	Read the Source File and determine frequencies of characters in the file COMPLETE

2.	Store the character frequencies in a heap COMPLETE
	-	make heap node .h/.cpp 	COMPLETE
	-	make heap tree .h/.cpp		COMPLETE
3.	Build tree of prefix codes 
	-	put characters in frequencies inside different nodes
	-	build a tree using those nodes
4.	Re-read source file for each character, write its prefix code to the output
